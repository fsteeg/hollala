changes from version 1.1 to version 1.2

- JDK 1.4-specific optimizations:
 * LRUCache uses LinkedListMap
 * PrincetonChannelDictionaryFile uses channels to improve performance over PrincetonRandomAccessDictionaryFile
- Reorganized packages:
 * moved PointerUtils to the net.didion.jwnl.data
 * moved cache-related classes (Cache, CacheSet, LRUCache, LRUCacheSet) to net.didion.jwnl.util.cache
 * move factory interfaces/classes (Creatable, Installable, Element, Param) to net.didion.jwnl.util.factory
 * eliminated the caching package
 * moved dictionary file classes (AbstractDictionaryFile, DictionaryCatalog, DictionaryCatalogSet, DictionaryFile, DictionaryFileType, ObjectDictionaryFile, RandomAccessDictionaryFile) to net.didion.jwnl.dictionary.file
- Shortened the names of the Princeton classes 
- Made the dictionary path a parameter for file-based dictionaries rather than a parameter of version
- Added clearCache() and clearCache(DictionaryFileType) methods to AbstractCachingDictionary
- Reversed the key types of DictionaryCatalog and DictionaryCatalogSet so that DictionaryCatalog stores files by POS for a file type and DictionaryCatalogSet stores DictionaryCatalogs by file type
- Changed DictionaryToMap to clear the cache for a file type after processing all the files of that type
- Got rid of the CacheSet.CacheKey class...it was pretty useless and unnecessary
- Fixed a bug in which "ches" endings were being stemmed to "c" instead of "ch"
