Hollaka Hollala - A Chatbot Engine and IRC Bot
----------------------------------------------

Description:

Hollaka Hollala is a chatbot engine and IRC bot. The chatbot engine uses a knowledge base organized in an XML file (using JDOM) and WordNet (using JWNL) for dictionary lookup. The IRC Bot features WordNet-based functionality (like a word guessing game and word definitions) and web-lookups (like translations) and is extensible through Ruby programs, which have total access to Java libraries (using JRuby).

Instructions:

0. Install WordNet 2.0 (http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wn2.0.shtml) NOTE: WordNet 2.1 is NOT SUPPORTED (due to JWNL)
1. Set the value attribute of the element "<param name="dictionary_path" value="/opt/hollala/wn/dict"/>" at the end of the "file_properties.xml" in the folder "config" to the location of your WordNet "dict" folder.
2. Set the ruby-property in the hollaka.properties file to your ruby lib directory
3. Set the other properties in the config/*.properties files as you desire
4. To run the IRC bots, execute com.quui.chat.ui.irc.RunBots.java (or run the JAR). To chat. mention "Hollala", for other commands enter "!help".
5. Add Ruby scripts to "src-ruby" in the format of the sample (see rot.rb) files to extend the running bot
6. For using the Chatbot Engine directly check out the class com.quui.chat.Talk
