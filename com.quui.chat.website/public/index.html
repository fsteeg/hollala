<h3>What's this about? And how does it work?</h3>

<p>Hollaka Hollala is a chatbot engine and IRC bot written in <a
	href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2006/03/08/what-is-java.html">Java</a>.
The chatbot engine uses a knowledge base organized in an <a
	href="http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp">XML</a> file and <a
	href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a> for dictionary lookup.
The <a href="http://www.mirc.com/irc.html">IRC</a> Bot has some WordNet-
and some Web-based functionality and is hot-extensible through <a
	href="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/chapter-3.html">Ruby</a> programs.</p>

<p>When you talk about something Hollala thinks he knows about he'll
try to talk to you on that topic. Also he will try to learn what you say
about that topic and related topics. If you talk about something thats
new to him he'll try to learn it. <b>You can talk to Hollala on IRC
in channel #hollala on server irc.freenode.net or in "<a
	href="http://www.quui.com/superchat">Superchat</a>"</b>. To chat with
Hollala, mention his name in your message. Besides the chatting
functionality there are a few other commands, to see what's available
enter "!help". Have fun!</p>
<h3>Some more detail, please...</h3>
<p>Hollaka Hollala is a learning chatbot engine and IRC bot. The
chatbot engine uses XML (using JDOM) to store the knowledge base and
WordNet (using JWNL) as an external resource. The knowledge base is
organized in topics, which consist of keywords and possible answers.
These are organized in a simple XML format. The program tries to find
the most suitable topic for a user input (e.g. using semantic relations
from WordNet and word counting). On the selected topic the answer is
then chosen randomly, where answers with higher frequencies (meaning
things often said by users) occur more often. This is a place for
possible extensions (e.g. speech act theory, pragmatics in general, any
comparison between possible anwers and input). When no suitable topic is
found new topics are made up from the user input, using information from
WordNet and the user input for initial content. The chatbot can
therefore start with an empty knowledge base and learn new topics and
answers for these topics from user conversation.</p>
<p>Besides the IRC bot there is a console-based and a Web-based
(both as a plain Java Servlet and as a JSP) interface to the chatbot
engine. The IRC Bot, besides providing an interface to the chatbot
engine, features some WordNet-based (like a word guessing game and word
definition lookups) and some Web-based functionality (like translation
services) and is hot-extensible (while the bot is running) through Ruby
programs, which have access to any Java libraries (by using JRuby).</p>
